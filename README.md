# aws-gdrop
GDrop is currently still in development stage but will be a way to revolutionize marketplace buying and selling across all platforms. It will allow user to easily communicate and book times to pickup, see or have delivered goods. It will help gain a lot of time wasted from buying and reselling things, and cut out the standard questions you receive like "Is this available?" and "Where and when can I pick it up?"
