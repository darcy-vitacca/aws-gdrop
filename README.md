Gâ€™Drop is a way to revolutionize marketplace buying and selling across all platforms. It allows user to easily communicate and book times to pickup, see or have delivered goods. It will help gain a lot of time wasted from buying and reselling things, and cut out the standard questions you receive like "Is this available?" and "Where and when can I pick it up?"
